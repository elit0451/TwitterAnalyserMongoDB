  NB! If you have *Windows*, please replace **$(pwd)** with the path to the directory of the repository

1. Run the following command in a new shell
`docker run -it --rm elit0452/dotnet`
	-  In case you don't have the image downloaded, it will be downloaded from Docker hub üê≥. 

1. Download the sample Twitter data with: 
`wget http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip`
1. Uncompress the Twitter dataset to your current directory with:
`unzip trainingandtestdata.zip`

1. Clone the project using the  following command **or** download the repository zip file
`git clone https://github.com/elit0451/TwitterAnalyserMongoDB.git`
1. Using a shell navigate to the folder where the repository is located
1. Use your favourite text editor and change the csv file location in *TweetsRepo.cs* file to the place where the `training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv` is being stored 
1. Similarly, edit the *MongoHelper.cs* file with your local machine's IP address (the port stays the same)
